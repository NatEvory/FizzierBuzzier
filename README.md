# FizzierBuzzier

This project came about because in job interviews I was asked to do the infamous "FizzBuzz".
I started thinking "This is boring, I should come up with amore interesting solution", so I did.
This is sort of a Code Kata to implement a more flexible and interesting FizzBuzz, thus FizzierBuzzier
